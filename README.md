### Summary of our work 
Under the influence of gravity, the water level in a glass remains flat and horizontal even when the glass is inclined. An exception occurs at the glassâ€™s edges, where the liquid slightly rises to form a meniscus. We confront this fundamental behavior by introducing 3D-printed devices engineered to curve liquid into limitless shapes and extents.

### Content
This repository contains STL files for the devices used in the article.  
This repository also contains the Mathematica code for creating an arrangement of truncated conical spines in which the liquid topography will reproduce a gray-scale image.
